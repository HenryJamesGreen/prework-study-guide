# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A study guide for course pre-work.

This webpage is a handy revision tool, designed for bootcamp students. It contains information learned in the pre-work module, assigned before the start of the bootcamp. This resource is born out of two main necessities. The first is the need for a handy resource to remind students of information, including processes, terms or even just pointers. The second is the process of actually building a webpage, in an effort to put said theories into practice, thus learning by doing. By performing these tasks, I have learnt the basic starting principles of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GitHub, as well as how to create a README file (just as this one).

The Prework Study Guide Webpage can be used as a revision aid for beginners' notes on HTML, CSS, GitHub and JavaScript. Within the DevTools console (accessible by pressing command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows)), you will see JavaScript running, presenting a list of topics, and suggesting one for you to study first.
