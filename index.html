          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

            An element refers to the type of content on a webpage. Common
            elements include text elements, image elements, header elements and
            list elements
          </li>
          <li>
            Common elements used to divide and describe a page (head) include
            meta-related elements, content division elements and semantic
            elements.

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            CSS defines the colours, aesthetics, visual layout, and organisation
            of a webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS,
            internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inline CSS - styling an element in the HTML file, using a style
            attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular element only (quick
            but less flexible, as can only be used once).
          </li>
          <li>
            Internal style sheet - contains CSS rules for the webpage in the
            head section of the HTML file. Rules only apply to that page, and
            you can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in
            the page code.
          </li>
          <li>
            External CSS style sheet - the most common - allows developers to
            keep all their CSS rules in a separate file. This CSS file has to be
            linked to the HTML, by using a link element placed in the HTML's
            head.
          </li>
          <li>
            Selector - Defines the element or attributes to which the
            declarations will apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            Declarations - contain two components: CSS property and value of the
            property.
          </li>
          <li>
            Margin - think of a word processing document - how much space we
            want outside of an element. Will not be visible on the page (when
            set to 0, it will add no extra space around the element).
          </li>
          <li>
            Padding - adds space around the content inside the element. If you
            increase padding, it makes the whole element bigger.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model"

              >The CSS box model.</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            * (wild card symbol) - all elements on the page will have the style
            properties within the brackets as its value (eg, padding and margin
            0).
          </li>
          <li>
            DRY - Do Not Repeat Yourself - rule that encourages developers to
            share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code
            that need to be written or maintained.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can use the comma (,) to apply the same rules to different
            selectors.
          </li>
          <li>
            The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the
            markup.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the display property is assigned with the block value, each image
            will start on a new line.
          </li>
          <li>
            Class attributes - allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we
            choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute within a class
            selector.

            Repository (repo) - a folder for your project that contains all
            files and their version history.
          </li>
          <li>
            Branch - GitHub workflow process - makes experience “clean”. Can
            merge changes back in to one place. Changes don't affect main branch
            or live site. Can make revisions without impacting anything else
            within repo.

          <li>
            Markdown file - a way to write and style text using plain text -
            easily converts to html (.md).

          <li>
            Commit - saving a new version of the file that you're working on.
            Adding, editing or deleting a file within your repo. Adding a change
            to branch you're working on.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pull Request ('PR') - move the change that's happening on your
            branch into the main branch. Asking for your changes to be pulled in
            or merged into another branch. Be specific about things you have
            changed etc. Within req it will list changes to any files you worked
            on. Next thing - someone reviews, discuss your work etc, have
            everyone agree upon changes etc to get published.
          </li>
          <li>
            Merge(d) - when changes are actually pulled in from your branch to
            the main. In the process of being published and deployed into live
            site.
          </li>
          <li>
            Issue - how we're tracking the work that is happening. Where you
            might report bug fixes or new features. Create an issue for any new
            content you want to add to site or fix. Tracked on content board
            (backing, to do, in progress). Include an attachment of word or
            google doc file so that everyone can see it. Can label the issue as
            to what it is (eg 'content').
