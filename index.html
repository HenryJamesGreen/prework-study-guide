            &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt - tells the browser what document type it should
            expect when opened. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML
            elements are case-sensitive.
          </li>
          <li>
            &ltHTML&gt - root, or start of HTML document. Inside is the
            lang=“en” - tells the browser the language for the webpage. An HTML
            attribute defines additional info about an element. HTML attributes
            are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing one.

            &ltHead&gt - Contains the metadata for the web application. Contains
            important info about accessibility, search engines and performance.
            Inside the &lthead&gt, we can use the following metadata tags:
            <ul>
              <li>&lttitle&gt - extremely important for SEO.</li>
              <li>&ltstyle&gt - defines the CSS associated with a website.</li>

                &ltlink&gt - connects an external resource to the HTML document.
              </li>
              <li>&ltmeta&gt - defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author and viewport (more - <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp target="_blank">w3schools</a></li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            CSS defines the colours, aesthetics, visual layout, and organisation
            of a webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS,
            internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inline CSS - styling an element in the HTML file, using a style
            attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular element only (quick
            but less flexible, as can only be used once).
          </li>
          <li>
            Internal style sheet - contains CSS rules for the webpage in the
            head section of the HTML file. Rules only apply to that page, and
            you can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in
            the page code.
          </li>
          <li>
            External CSS style sheet - the most common - allows developers to
            keep all their CSS rules in a separate file. This CSS file has to be
            linked to the HTML, by using a link element placed in the HTML's
            head.
          </li>
          <li>
            Selector - Defines the element or attributes to which the
            declarations will apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            Declarations - contain two components: CSS property and value of the
            property.
          </li>
          <li>
            Margin - think of a word processing document - how much space we
            want outside of an element. Will not be visible on the page (when
            set to 0, it will add no extra space around the element).
          </li>
          <li>
            Padding - adds space around the content inside the element. If you
            increase padding, it makes the whole element bigger.
          </li>
          <li>

              >The CSS box model.</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            * (wild card symbol) - all elements on the page will have the style
            properties within the brackets as its value (eg, padding and margin
            0).
          </li>
          <li>
            DRY - Do Not Repeat Yourself - rule that encourages developers to
            share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code
            that need to be written or maintained.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can use the comma (,) to apply the same rules to different
            selectors.
          </li>
          <li>
            The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the
            markup.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the display property is assigned with the block value, each image
            will start on a new line.
          </li>
          <li>
            Class attributes - allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we
            choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute within a class
            selector.

            Repository (repo) - a folder for your project that contains all
            files and their version history.
          </li>
          <li>
            Branch - GitHub workflow process - makes experience “clean”. Can
            merge changes back in to one place. Changes don't affect main branch
            or live site. Can make revisions without impacting anything else
            within repo.

          <li>
            Markdown file - a way to write and style text using plain text -
            easily converts to html (.md).
          </li>
          <li>
            Commit - saving a new version of the file that you're working on.
            Adding, editing or deleting a file within your repo. Adding a change
            to branch you're working on.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pull Request ('PR') - move the change that's happening on your
            branch into the main branch. Asking for your changes to be pulled in
            or merged into another branch. Be specific about things you have
            changed etc. Within req it will list changes to any files you worked
            on. Next thing - someone reviews, discuss your work etc, have
            everyone agree upon changes etc to get published.
          </li>
          <li>
            Merge(d) - when changes are actually pulled in from your branch to
            the main. In the process of being published and deployed into live
            site.

          <li>
            Issue - how we're tracking the work that is happening. Where you
            might report bug fixes or new features. Create an issue for any new
            content you want to add to site or fix. Tracked on content board
            (backing, to do, in progress). Include an attachment of word or
            google doc file so that everyone can see it. Can label the issue as
            to what it is (eg 'content').

          <li>
            A variable - a named container that allows us to store data in our
            code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Control flow - the order in which a computer executes code in a
            script.
          </li>
          <li>
            Declare a variable - var keyword. After var, we give the variable a
            name. Must be unique, as it is how we will reference the information
            stored in the variable within our code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Operators - a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on
            two values (+,-,*,/)
          </li>
          <li>
            = - assignment operator - assigns the specific data that we want
            stored in our variable.
          </li>
          <li>
            === - Strict equality - performs a test to see if two values are
            equal. Returns a boolean result.
          </li>
          <li>
            (!,!==) - Not, Does-not-equal - returns the logically opposite value
            of what it precedes. When used alongside an equality operator, the
            negation operator tests whether two values are not equal (so
            basically, the question is “is myVariable NOT equal to 3”, will
            return false if myVariable IS qual to 3).
          </li>
          <li>
            Console - refers to a test environment that developers use to check
            out their code. .log() - a method, which means a set of instructions
            that can be executed by a computer. Will output anything we put in
            the parenthesis to the console.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the html file, add a link, such as &ltscript
            src=“./assets/script.js” &gt; between the footer and body element
          </li>
          <li>
            If statement - introduces decision-making into our code. Conditions
            must be met (ie'if'). The computer will approach the if statement
            and check whether the condition is truthy. If yes, it will do what's
            inside {}, if no, it'll ignore and move on.
          </li>
          <li>
            Truthy - all other data types, including Boolean with the value of
            true.
          </li>
          <li>
            Falsy value - 0, -0, On, “”, null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data
            type with the value of false.
          </li>
          <li>
            Else if - sometimes we want to have more conditions than just if.
          </li>
          <li>
            Boolean === checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a
            Boolean result.
          </li>
          <li>
            Array - a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.
          </li>
          <li>
            To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way as
            previous, but assign the variable to a group of values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arrays are not restricted to a single type of data. Strings,
            numbers, and more can be stored too.
          </li>
          <li>
            A for loop - uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a
            task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to
            be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement to
            interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific
            number of times.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to use the for loop: 1. Shape's index 2. Array's length -
            how many times it'll run before there are no items left in the
            array. Can find it's length by using a built-in property of an
            array, named 'length'.
          </li>
          <li>
            For loop statements - 1 - Starting point for our loop. Declare a
            variable x and give it a value of 0 (var x = 0;). 2 - The condition
            - As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of
            the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to
            execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length
            property on our shapes array to express that condition. Instructing
            the computer to repeat our code as long as our variable x is less
            than the length of the shape's array (x &lt shapes.length;). 3 -
            Allows the array to iterate over each item. Some indices follow a
            predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time.
            The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the
            code loops, x will increase by 1 (for(var x = 0; x &lt
            shapes.length; x++) { //code block } ). Finally, we put the code we
            want to be executed inside the {}. In our case,. We want the shapes
            to be logged in the console. In place of an actual index number, we
            can add the variable x from our for loop (for(var x = 0; x &lt
            shapes.length; x++) { Console.log(shapes[x]); })
          </li>
          <li>
            Functions - In most basic form - a set of instructions that tells
            the computer how to perform a certain task. Differs from a for loop
            or conditional statement - does not automatically execute when the
            JavaScript file is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in
            order to execute it.
